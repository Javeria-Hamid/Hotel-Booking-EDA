# Hotel Booking Analysis â€” EDA Project

This project explores a comprehensive hotel booking dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to uncover key trends and patterns related to customer bookings, cancellations, seasonal effects, lead time, and customer preferences.

## Objectives

- Analyze hotel booking and cancellation trends.
- Understand the influence of:
  - Lead time
  - Customer type and preferences
  - Deposit types
  - Seasonality
- Generate visual insights to assist hoteliers in:
  - Marketing strategies
  - Pricing models
  - Enhancing guest experience

## Dataset

The dataset contains real-world hotel booking records, including attributes such as:

- Booking status
- Hotel type (City/Resort)
- Customer type
- Lead time
- Deposit types
- Market segment
- Arrival dates
- Number of guests
- and more...

## Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, formatting)
- Value counts & distributions
- GroupBy analysis
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations
- Count comparisons
- Categorical and time-based exploration

## Sample Visualizations

- Cancellation trends by hotel type and customer type
- Lead time impact on booking status
- Monthly booking trends
- Repeated guest analysis

## Insights

- City hotels have higher cancellation rates.
- Certain customer types and deposit policies are more likely to cancel.
- Seasonal and monthly trends reveal booking peaks and dips.
- Repeated guests show significantly lower cancellation likelihood.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the notebook or script in Jupyter or any Python environment
4. View visualizations and insights

## Output

Visualizations and insights that can help hoteliers and data-driven decision makers understand:
- When and why guests cancel
- What type of guests are more reliable
- How to optimize bookings based on customer and seasonal patterns
